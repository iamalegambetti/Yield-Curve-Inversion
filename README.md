<h1>
<bold>GOAL OF THE RESEARCH</bold>
</h1>

The goal of the research is to point out which stock sectors perform the best during and after an inversion of the yield curve, this curve showing the relationship between the interest rate and the time to maturity, known as the "term", of the debt for a given borrower in a given currency. 
A not superficial point to stress is that the yield curve is considered by most asset managers as a good predictor for recession. 

<h1> HOW IT WORKS </h1>
I selected the spread between 10 years treasury constant maturity bonds and the 2 year treasury constant maturity bonds to track the yield curve performance. To track the various sectorsâ€™ performances I selected the top 3 ETFs for market capitalization for each sector analysed after the 2000 comprised (when possible).
After downloading the Time Series for 33 ETFs for 11 industries: Materials, Financials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples, Energy, Healthcare, Utilities, Telecommunications, Industrials, Technology and Real Estate, I studied how the etfs linked to those industries performed during:
<ul>
  <li>The period during the yield curve inversion,</li>
  <li>The period after the yield curve inversion.</li>
</ul>

During After Inversion.ipynb reflects the summary statistics of the research, pointing out the results of the goal of the project.
